# StockHawk Android App 
StockHawk is the third project of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. 
The app currently finds stock prices from the internet and allows users to add stocks to track.

The purpose of this project was to productionize it, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state which 
involved finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, 
and adding a library.

Key Features that I did:
- Added a widget that displays stock quotes on the home screen.
- Added a library to show more details of stock using chart to track their prices over time.
- Diagnosed existing issues with the app.
- Made the app accessible to sight-impaired users.
- Allowed the app to be localized for distribution in other countries.
- Handled error cases in Android.
